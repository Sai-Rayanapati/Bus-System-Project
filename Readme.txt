Mark:

-       readBusStations file was added.
-       Added TST, StdIn and Queue classes. (TST barely worked)
-       Fixed TST issues and realized that StdIn is not necessary.. 
-       Added main method in TST in order to see the output.
-       Made an additional method in readBusStation class.
-       Used an additional 2d array so TST prints out all information regarding each bus stop.
-       Made final changes so the code looks better and works properly.
-       Added activareSearchSystem method so it can be easily integrated with the command line.
